# Music Manager
## Introduction

This programm is for people who likes to hear music in a random loop so that one song will not appear after it has already been played but maybe will show up again before the whole list is finished. It is simply random.
## Note

This programm is not finished, so there will be some errors and it needs a lot more testing before it works like it should.
At the moment only mp3 files are working but even some of the mp3 files arent running. I try to fix this problem.
## Importet libraries

* pyglet

## Bug reports

Please use the "issues" tool of GitHub to report bugs and errors.
## Main Goal

My main goal is that everyone can hear music edit the metadata of the songs in one programm and also save the playlists position and chance rate so you will not have the same song again if you restart the programm or computer.
